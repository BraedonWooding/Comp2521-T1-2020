# Tree Implementations

Most major trees are implemented [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/Comp2521-T1-2020/tree/master/Detailed_TreeImplementations/)

I've included only an insertion and a find in most implementations.

A deletion for most is pretty easy (just remove node and rebalance) but the files were already getting very large...

Also for the sake of final exams and midsems / assignments you really only need to know insertion / find :).

!> There may be bugs in the implementations since I haven't exhaustively tested them, if you notice anything let me know!
