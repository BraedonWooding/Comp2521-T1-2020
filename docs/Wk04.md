# Week 4 (BST + Revision)

## Height Difference

For each node in the tree print out the difference between the 2 subtrees.

And return the height of the tree.  To not make this question feel nice if it is an empty tree do nothing.

```c
// print the height difference between both left and right subtrees
// for every node in a given binary tree.
int printHeightDiff(BSTree t) {

}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct BSTNode *BSTree;
typedef struct BSTNode {
  int value;
  BSTree left;
  BSTree right;
} BSTNode;

// print the height difference between both left and right subtrees
// for every node in a given binary tree.
int printHeightDiff(BSTree t) {
    if (t == NULL) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        int left = printHeightDiff(t->left);
        int right = printHeightDiff(t->right);
        int diff = left - right;
        if (diff < 0) diff *= -1;
        printf("Diff is %d for node %d\n", diff, t->value);
        if (left > right) return left + 1;
        else              return right + 1;
    }
}
```

## Can we detect if a tree is balanced

?> What makes a balanced tree

```c
#define TREE_IS_NOT_BALANCED (-99)

// Return height of tree if it is balanced else
// return -99 is it is not balanced
int isHeightBalanced(BSTree t) {

}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct BSTNode *BSTree;
typedef struct BSTNode {
  int value;
  BSTree left;
  BSTree right;
} BSTNode;

#define TREE_IS_NOT_BALANCED (-99)

// Return height of tree if it is balanced else
// return -99 is it is not balanced
int isHeightBalanced(BSTree t) {
    if (t == NULL) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        int left = isHeightBalanced(t->left);
        int right = isHeightBalanced(t->right);
        int diff = left - right;
        if (diff < 0) diff *= -1;

        if (left == TREE_IS_NOT_BALANCED ||
            right == TREE_IS_NOT_BALANCED ||
            diff > 1) {
            return TREE_IS_NOT_BALANCED;
        } else {
            if (left > right) return left + 1;
            else              return right + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Computing the width of a tree

- If the tree is empty it has width 0
- A tree with a single node has width of 3
- All other trees have width which is 3 more than the sum of the width of their children

?> Kind of a useless question since its not really always correct but eh still along the same idea as the rest.

```c
int width(BSTree t) {
}
```
