# Week 05

All 4 major trees (Splay, AVL, 2-3-4, Red Black) are implemented [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/Comp2521-T1-2020/tree/master/Detailed_TreeImplementations/)

> You don't need to know red black but people always ask so I wrote it up this year.

## Splay Trees

### Example

Given the insertion order `5 3 8 7 4` how will the tree look at each stage?

Let `t` be the answer to the above question, what will the tree look like after each of the following;

- `search(t, 7)`
- `search(t, 8)`
- `search(t, 6)`

## AVL Trees

!> IMPORTANT: In previous exams they have asked questions that require you to know that AVL trees have to be balanced, what denotes that a tree is an AVL tree and thus is balanced?

### Example

?> `12 10 8 6 4 2` what is the resultant tree

## 2-3-4 Trees

I wrote both a 2-3-4 tree and a red black tree because I have no self control and knowledge over the pain that 2-3-4 tree implementations provide...  I do not recommend writing an implementation for it since they are very hard to get right (especially with deletion) instead just do a ton of examples!

> This is why if you google 2-3-4 implementation you won't find much and wikipedia even says "just go to red black" because red black trees are isomorphic to 2-3-4.

?> Insert `1 2 3 4 5 8 6 7 9 10` into a 2-3-4

?> What are the search costs for `1 7 9 13`

## Use Case: an AST

I'll do a short demostration on this if we get time
