## What does the following do?

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
 
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i, j, *a;
	int N = 0;
 
	// initialisation
	assert(argc > 1);
	sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &N);
	assert(N > 0);
	a = malloc(N*sizeof(int));
	assert(a != NULL);
	for (i = 2; i < N; i++) a[i] = 1;
 
	// computation
	for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
		if (a[i]) {
			for (j = i; i*j < N; j++) a[i*j] = 0;
		}
	}
 
	// results
	for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
		if (a[i]) printf("%d\n",i);
	}
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

It may seem obscure at first so let's break it down into individual lines;

- What does `assert` do?

- What happens when you don't have braces around for loop statements

- What does `sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &N)` do?

- Alternatives for `sscanf`?  There are a few...

- For each of the asserts
  - What are they checking
  - What is a better error message that we could display
  
- What does `exit` do?

- What is the value of `a[0]` and `a[1]` during the execution of the program
  - Do we care?  Do they even matter?
  
- What does the program produce

- What is Big O Notation?  i.e. `O(n)` what does that mean?  What does it tell us?

- What is the Big O Notation of the above code?

## A 'real' world example!

`CPath` demonstration from [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/cpath).

Python is known to be very slow but here you can see that that it's actually faster than Cute Files and TinyDir which are written in C!!!!

| Test                     | User   | System | Wall   |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CPath (Recursion in C)   | 0.020s | 0.062s | 0.082s |
| CPath (Emplace in C)     | 0.020s | 0.063s | 0.083s |
| CPath (Recursive in cpp) | 0.020s | 0.062s | 0.082s |
| CPath (Emplace in cpp)   | 0.020s | 0.063s | 0.083s |
| find                     | 0.021s | 0.126s | 0.147s |
| Python (os.walk)         | 0.156s | 0.081s | 0.237s |
| Cute Files (C)           | 0.041s | 0.243s | 0.284s |
| TinyDir (C)              | 0.050s | 0.244s | 0.294s |
| tree                     | 0.369s | 0.256s | 0.626s |

Why?

- Look at the user time, what does that mean?
- What is system time?  What does this indicate to us?

What does this tell us!

Feel free to check out the code [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/cpath) but keep in consideration it is just a rough sketch and a lot of the code is prone to change as I head towards stabilisation :).

And continuing on this note let us write some bash code to generate a ridiculous amount of files!

This will help with this week's lab if you want to write some testing code!

```bash
mkdir tmp
for i in {1..9}; do
  mkdir "tmp/a$i"
  for j in {1..99}; do
    mkdir "tmp/a$i/b$j"
    for k in {1..49}; do
      touch "tmp/a$i/b$j/$k.tmp"
    done
  done
done
```

This is pretty straightforward and not examinable, knowing bash in this course is really important as it can make some automation tasks much much much easier!!!

In C using my library it'll be something like

```c
#include "cpath.h"

int main(void) {
    cpath path = cpathFromUtf8("tmp");
    cpathMkdir(&path);

    for (cpath_char_t i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        cpathAppendSprintf(&path, "/a%d", i);
        cpathMkdir(&path);
    
        for (cpath_char_t j = 1; j < 100; j++) {
            cpathAppendSprintf(&path, "/b%d", j);
            cpathMkdir(&path);
        
            for (cpath_char_t k = 1; k < 50; k++) {
                cpathAppendSprintf(&path, "/%d.tmp", k);
                FILE *f = cpathOpen(&path, CPATH_STR("w"));
                fclose(f);
                cpathUpDir(&path);
            }
            cpathUpDir(&path);
        }
        cpathUpDir(&path);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Can you see the similarities to the above bash example?

Want to see the time difference!

Let's run it ourselves we'll have to leave the bash program for a few minutes so we'll run the C program first.

I'm going to run these on my Mac because well the CSE servers are quite a bit slower in terms of IO with the C program taking about 6x the time so it took over 10 mins for the bash program which we don't really have to wait :).  Feel free to copy the files and run it yourself though if you want.

- Carrying on what we were talking about before what perks your interest about the time spent
  - Clearly the user time is high but what about that system time!
  
One small final note about benchmarking:
- Be really really really careful, you'll always get the benchmarks wrong the first time.  Either you'll compile with the wrong settings or write a program that is slow and claim it is the language.
- User Time + System Time != Wall Time, so just tracking how long it took your program to complete is often not a good idea.  For example if I run the program with spotify and chrome and emacs and a billion other things it takes a longer amount of time because the OS has to divide up it's resources between each program.  So NEVER trust the wall time, always aim for user time.  In some cases you care about system time but in the lab you will ONLY care about user time.

As a rule of thumb if your conclusions ever is
- X language is faster than Y language always
- X framework/library is faster than Y framework/library always
- My code is faster than your code always

Then you probably are wrong always think about cases.

The following are valid claims:

- The C programming language will often outperform Python in user time given equally optimised non-trivial programs
- X sort is faster than Y sort in the random case
- BogoSort is the one of the greatest sorting algorithms ever only surparsed by miracle sort.

## IO

What are the following
- argc/argv
- stdin/stdout/stderr

Consider the following program

```c
// my_prog.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("%s", argv[1]);
    putchar(getchar());
    return 0;
}
```

If we executed the following;

```bash
$ gcc my_prog.c -o my_prog
$ ./my_prog hello there, "John Shepard" < in > out
```

The file `out` contains `Hello Sailor` and the file `in` contains just the word `hey` prior the running the second command.

- What is argc and argv?
- Where does getchar take it's character from
- What is printed out to terminal and what is the contents of `out` and `in` after running the command.
- What does `>>` do compared to `>`

## More IO

What does each of the following do.  Note `int x;` is defined prior.

- `scanf("%d", x)`
- `scanf("%d", &x)`
- `printf("%d", x)`
- `fscanf(stdin, "%d", &x)`
- `fscanf(stderr, "%d", &x)`
- `fprintf(stdout, "%d", x)`
- `fprintf(stderr, "%d", x)`

## Functions

- Make a swap function that exchanges 2 elements in an array. i.e. `swap(array, i, j)` will swap `array[i]` and `array[j]`

Consider the following Linked List

```c
typedef struct _node_t {
    int value;
    struct _node_t *next;
} Node;

typedef Node *List;
```

- What is good about the typedefs, what is bad?  Is there any ambiguity
- Write a function to sum up the list using while, for, and then recursive
