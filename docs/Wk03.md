# Week 3 Binary Search Trees(BSTs)

The following website may help to visualise recursion [here](https://visualgo.net/en/recursion).

For the tutorial we will consider the following tree:

```c
typedef struct BSTNode *BSTree;
typedef struct BSTNode {
  int value;
  BSTree left;
  BSTree right;
} BSTNode;
```

![Orders](assets/img/tree-orders.png)

I think it is easier to visualise how to handle the orders via some code.  The basic way to recurse through a BST is :

```c
void recurse_bst(BSTree tree) {
  if (tree != NULL) {
    // 1)
    recurse_bst(tree->left);
    // 2)
    recurse_bst(tree->right);
    // 3)
  }
}
```

Now we can place the following line `printf("%d ", tree->value);` at any one of the positions 1) 2) and 3).

What happens to the order when we do?

1. We print out our node before we do our 'children' this is called 'prefix'
2. We do it after our left node i.e. we are in the middle of our two children we call this 'infix'
3. We do it at the end this is called 'postfix'

?> Are there any trees that have infix == prefix?

<p>

Trees with no left children i.e. a tree that has only children to the right making it look like a linked list that is tilted.

i.e.

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    5
     \
      9
       \
        ...
          \
           N
```

Also empty and single node tree.

Empty and single node trees.

## Some terminology

- Every node (excluding the root) are connected by a directed edge (can be bidirectional in some setups) from exactly one other node this node is called a parent.  On the other hand you can be connected to multiple other nodes they are called your 'children'.
- Leafs have no children nodes
- Root nodes have no parents
- Depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node (0 for empty tree)
- Depth of a tree is the max number of nodes from the root to any leaf (0 for empty tree)
- Height of a node is the number of nodes from the node to the deepest leaf (0 for empty tree and 0 for leafs)
- Note Height of a tree == Depth of a tree. (0 for empty tree)

## Some Exercises

The answers to all coding exercises are under Tute3_Files right [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/Comp2521-T1-2020/tree/master/Tute3_Files).  But I'll also put them under each exercise for easy access.

### Count Internal

Implement the following; find and return the number of non leaf nodes in a binary tree.

```c
int countInternal(BSTree t) {
  int count = 42;
  return count;
}
```

<details>

<p>

```c
int countInternal(BSTree t) {
    if (t == NULL) {
        // Case: Empty Tree, an empty tree has no internal nodes
        return 0;
    } else if (t->left == NULL && t->right == NULL) {
        // Case: A leaf node, a leaf node is not an internal node
        //       You could also visualise this as a single tree with a single
        //       node.
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Case: Other, this has children so it's an internal node
        //       either of it's children could also be internal so we check both
        return countInternal(t->left) + countInternal(t->right) + 1;
    }
}
```

</p></details>

### Node Depth

Finds the depth of the given node containing key.  If no node contains key return -1.  Perform in O(log n) IF tree is balanced.

```c
int nodeDepth(BSTree t, int key) {
  int depth = 42;
  return depth;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

<p>

```c
int nodeDepth(BSTree t, int key) {
    if (t == NULL) {
        // Case: Empty tree, in an empty tree the key cannot exist
        //       so we return -1 to signify that it has no node with value key
        return -1
    } else if (t->value == key) {
        // Case: Tree with 'root' value == key so we found it
        // Note: 'root' since this isn't necessarily the very root of the tree
        //       but we can view it as the root of this subtree
        return 1;
    } else if (key > t->value) {
        // Case: Tree with key > 'root' value therefore we must visit
        //       right subtree.
        int count = nodeDepth(t->right);
        if (count != -1) {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    } else { /* key < t->value */
        // Case: Tree with key < 'root' value therefore we must visit
        //       left subtree.
        int count = nodeDepth(t->left);
        if (count != -1) {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Max Branch Length

Find the height of a tree. i.e. the maximum branch length if a branch is a path from root to a leaf.

```c
int BSTreeMaxBranchLen(BSTree t) {
  int maxBranches = 42;
  return maxBranches;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```c
int BSTreeMaxBranchLen(BSTree t) {
    if (t == NULL) {
        // Case: Empty tree has a max branch len of 0
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Case: Non empty tree has a max branch length of the maximum
        //       branch length of it's left subtree and right subtree
        //       +1 (for itself)
        int left = BSTreeMaxBranchLen(t->left);
        int right = BSTreeMaxBranchLen(t->right);
        // This is called a 'ternary' operator (ternary meaning 3 arguments)
        // often called the 'ternary' conditional operator
        // structure is: cond ? if_true : if_false
        // i.e. this is very very similar to...
        // if (left > right) { return left + 1; } else { return right + 1; }
        return (left > right ? left : right) + 1;
    }
}
```

## Can we apply Postfix to other things?

Yes!

For example let's print out a linked list in reverse :O.  But you can't edit the list OR malloc or any crazy stuff!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct LLNode *LList;
typedef struct LLNode {
    LList next;
    int value;
} LLNode;

void print_reverse(LList list);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    LList head = NULL;

    // Q: Why do it backwards?
    for (int i = argc - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
        LList new = malloc(sizeof *new);
        new->next = head;
        new->value = atoi(argv[i]);
        head = new;
    }
    print_reverse(head);
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}

// Don't include the '\n' at the end, it's better practice to avoid printing newlines
// if you may want to do it multiple times in a single line in the future
// i.e. printing list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> X in reverse is X <- 3 <- 2 <- 1
void print_reverse(LList list) {
}
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```c
void print_reverse(LList list) {
    if (list == NULL) {
        printf("X");
    } else {
        // if we flip the order then it'll print normally
        // just like prefix / postfix
        print_reverse(list->next);
        printf(" <- %d", list->value);
    }
}
```
