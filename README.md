Comp 2521 Resources / Tutorials

This is for both T09A and W11B classes for the sake of providing equal material and resources I'll delay putting up the finalised tutorial answeres/notes till Wednesday at the least.

Quite a bit of the tutorial is spent on the board or in a text editor playing around with concepts so do try to attend tutorials :).

I'll may put up some more exam practice questions towards the end of semester but it'll depend on the ones that are officially released.

I'll also put up resources that are relevant but either no examined or only partially examinable just for interest.
